    <# 
    The maximum number of players that can be on the team.
    This is useful for games that have a 'base' that players can claim and share resources with each other.
    This kit isn't optimised for >1 players(Hence this not being editable); however, it will techincally function and work with multiple players.
    The kit will work with multiple players, money distribution, and all the other features that are included in the kit will be handled by the base.
    Some features will elect to grant money to all players in the base on event; whilst others will grant money to the player that triggered the event.
    I do not recommend changing this unless you know what you're doing.
